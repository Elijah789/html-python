    <p>Editors word:<br>
      When I first was intrdoucet to html<br>
      I thought it was a boring language,<br>
      untill I actully started to learn html,<br>
      thats when I realized that it is actually<br>
      pretty intersting. so I decided to learn <br>
      it fully. </p>
    
   <p>
      Once I started Html, in order to make<br>
      the web cool I needed to learn CSS,<br>
      which is the styling language.
